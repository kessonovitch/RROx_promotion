Hi All,

Now that the dust has settled from a very busy Week 9, we’d like to thank you all for getting involved with RROx. Your time and effort is much appreciated, either in helping/instruction at the workshop on Monday and Tuesday or in getting trained as an instructor.

We’re now looking forward to Trinity Term and making our plans for what to do next in order to keep up the momentum we’ve built for the cause of research reproducibility and open research at Oxford.

We are considering the following weeks for a TT workshop: W{FIXME}.

We’ve added the dates on the etherpad https://etherpad.net/p/RROxford {TODO}.

If you are available and interested in being an instructor or a helper for one or more of the workshops please put your name down. If you are an instructor, please also note what you’d be willing to teach.

We will be meeting on the {FIXME} to discuss our plans for going forward.

Thanks again,
RROx
