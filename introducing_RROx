Reproducible Research Oxford is a project based at the University of Oxford, supported by the IT Innovation Challenges Fund.
We are a group of researchers and staff who are passionate about research reproducibility and open research. We aim to bring together expertise in these areas from across the University.

Our focus is on training in the effective use of computational tools in research. To this end, we have set up a partnership with Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, non-profit volunteer organisations focused on teaching researchers across disciplines the computing and data skills they need for effective and reproducible research. We will coordinate and deliver a series of Carpentry workshops open to all across the University, and we will train Carpentry instructors to build local capacity in this area.

See our website (https://rroxford.github.io/) and follow us on Twitter @RR_Oxford to find out more about the project, our past and future events, and how to get involved. Email us at ReproducibleResearchOxford@gmail.com to get in touch.
Our events are free and open to all! Next event:
